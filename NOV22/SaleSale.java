package NOV22;
//        We have a list of Sale objects, each representing a sale with the attributes
//        product,amount & date.Write a Java stream pipeline to analyze the sales data. Perform
//        the following operations:
//        Filter: Filter out sales that occurred before a specific date, say, January 1, 2023.
//        Grouping: Group the remaining sales by product.
//        Summation: Calculate the total amount of sales for each product.
//        Sorting: Sort the products based on their total sales in descending order.
//        Limit: Display the top three products with the highest total sales.
//        Write the Java stream pipeline to accomplish the above tasks and output the result.

//  A Stream PipeLine Mainly Consists of 3 Main Operations
// 1. Source
//      Object provides data to stream like collection, array, file, or any other object which support Stream Interface.
// 2. Intermediate Operations
//      that can transform data present in stream like filter, map, sorted etc............
// 3. Terminal Operation
//      Consumes Data in the stream and produces result like foreach, collect, reduce, count etc............
